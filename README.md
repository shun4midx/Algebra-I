# Shun's Algebra I Notes

Some (Abstract) Algebra I notes I made during Fall 2024

I plan to upload my biweekly notes for Algebra II during Spring 2025, but I figured they won't make sense without prior context, so I'm attaching my Algbera I notes here.

Algebra I mainly covered Group Theory and a brief introduction to Cohomological Algebra, whereas Algebra II will focus more on Ring and Field Theory, including Galois Theory and Commutative Algebra.

I like to take notes by hand using GoodNotes, because I find it most natural and pretty this way. Since it is my own preference, I would not upload a LaTeX file equivalent for my notes, it should be enjoyed as is.
